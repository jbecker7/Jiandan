# Jiandan

Jiandan (简单) means simple. I wanted to make the most bare bones task manager that I possibly could, tailored for my own needs. My goal is to waste less time making complex Notion tables and Google Calendar entries and just boil down what I need to do for school with a splash of OOP.

I used the pickle module to handle saving and loading files so that I can keep my assignments saved. This is an awfully unoriginal idea, but I only did it to make my own version and not have to bother with finding other software. I might try to improve it with a GUI or something, but that seems unnecessary.
